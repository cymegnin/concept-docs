'Stack' is, admittedly, very much an over used term in our industry. It seems that for some reason, everyone is quick to redefine it. 

...and we are certainly no different!

A 'stack' for us is everything in your cloud deployment. ***Virtual Machines*** are a given, but we include *everything else* as well. What does *everything else* actually mean? Well, *everything*.

* Networks
* Managed Services
  * Databases
  * Search
  * Queues

* Network Cards
* DNS Entries
* Scaling Policies
